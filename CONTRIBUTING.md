# Contributing to Minimal Browser

Welcome to the Minimal Browser project! This guide will help you get set up and contributing effectively, whether you're working independently or integrating AI-suggested modifications.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** (required for PySide6 compatibility)
- **uv** package manager ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **OpenRouter API key** for AI functionality (optional for development)

### Development Setup

#### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matias-ceau/minimal_browser.git
cd minimal_browser

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set up environment (optional, for AI features)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Test the installation
uv run python -m py_compile src/minimal_browser/main.py
```

#### Option 2: Using pip (Fallback)

If `uv` is not available in your environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matias-ceau/minimal_browser.git
cd minimal_browser

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies manually (refer to pyproject.toml)
pip install openai>=1.107.2 pyside6>=6.9.2 requests>=2.32.5 pydantic>=2.8.2

# Set up environment (optional, for AI features)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Test the installation
python -m py_compile src/minimal_browser/main.py
```

### Running the Browser

```bash
# Basic run
uv run python -m minimal_browser

# With a starting URL
uv run python -m minimal_browser https://github.com

# Development mode (for debugging)
uv run python -m minimal_browser --debug
```

## ü§ñ Working with AI-Suggested Modifications

### Understanding AI Suggestions

AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude) can suggest code modifications for this project. Here's how to effectively work with them:

#### What AI Can Help With
- **Code completion** for existing patterns
- **Bug fixes** based on error messages  
- **Feature implementation** following established architecture
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Refactoring** to improve code quality

#### What to Watch Out For
- **Architecture violations** - AI might not understand our engine abstraction or modal patterns
- **Dependency issues** - AI might suggest packages we don't want to add
- **Security concerns** - Especially around HTML rendering and WebEngine settings
- **Breaking changes** - AI might not understand backward compatibility needs

### When AI Suggests Code Changes

If you're working with GitHub Copilot or another AI assistant that suggests modifications:

1. **Read the suggestion carefully**
   - What is the AI trying to accomplish?
   - Does it align with our project goals?
   - Does it follow our architectural patterns?

2. **Understand the context**
   ```bash
   # Check which files the AI wants to modify
   # Review the current implementation first
   cat src/minimal_browser/[relevant_file].py
   
   # Check related architecture documentation
   grep -n "relevant_pattern" ARCHITECTURE.md
   ```

3. **Evaluate against project patterns**
   - **AI Actions**: Does it follow the Pydantic schema pattern?
   - **Web Engines**: Does it maintain the abstract interface?
   - **Modal UI**: Does it preserve vim-like behavior?
   - **Data URLs**: Does it use our established HTML rendering pattern?

4. **Test the changes**
   ```bash
   # Always compile-check first
   python -m py_compile src/minimal_browser/[modified_file].py
   
   # Then test functionality
   python -m minimal_browser  # or uv run if available
   ```

### Common AI Modification Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: "Add a new AI action type"
```python
# AI might suggest adding to src/minimal_browser/ai/schemas.py
class NewAction(BaseModel):
    action_type: Literal["new_feature"] = "new_feature"
    data: str
```

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Does it follow the existing `BaseModel` pattern?
- [ ] Is it added to the `AIAction` Union type?
- [ ] Is there a corresponding parser in `ResponseProcessor`?
- [ ] Is there a handler in the main browser class?

#### Scenario 2: "Improve error handling"
AI might suggest comprehensive try-catch blocks or error logging.

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Does it maintain user experience (notifications vs crashes)?
- [ ] Does it log appropriately without being too verbose?
- [ ] Does it preserve the modal interface during errors?

#### Scenario 3: "Add new keybinding"
AI might suggest new vim-like shortcuts.

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Does it conflict with existing shortcuts?
- [ ] Is it mode-aware (different behavior in NORMAL vs COMMAND mode)?
- [ ] Is it documented in the help system?

### Merging AI Modifications

#### Option 1: Direct Integration (Small Changes)
For small, straightforward changes:

```bash
# Apply the suggested changes to your files
# Test thoroughly
uv run python -m minimal_browser

# Commit with descriptive message
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [specific functionality]

- [describe what was changed]
- [note any AI assistance used]"
```

#### Option 2: Feature Branch (Larger Changes)
For substantial modifications:

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/ai-suggested-improvement

# Apply and test changes
# ... make modifications ...

# Test thoroughly
uv run python -m minimal_browser

# Commit with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [description of changes]"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/ai-suggested-improvement
```

#### Option 3: Incremental Integration (Complex Changes)
For complex AI suggestions:

1. **Break down the suggestion** into smaller, testable pieces
2. **Implement incrementally**, testing each piece
3. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
4. **Document any architectural implications**

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Code Style and Quality

```bash
# Format code (if ruff is available)
ruff format src/

# Type checking (if mypy is available)
mypy src/

# Basic syntax validation
uv run python -m py_compile src/minimal_browser/minimal_browser.py
```

### Testing Your Changes

Since we don't have automated tests yet, manual testing is crucial:

1. **Smoke test the core functionality**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m minimal_browser
   ```

2. **Test modal navigation**:
   - Try vim-like keybindings (hjkl, etc.)
   - Test command mode with `:q`, `:help`, `:e <url>`
   - Verify normal/insert mode switching

3. **Test AI integration** (if you have an API key):
   - Press `Space` to activate AI mode
   - Try different AI commands (navigate, search, generate HTML)
   - Verify response parsing works correctly

4. **Test web engine functionality**:
   - Navigate to different websites
   - Test page rendering and interaction
   - Verify developer tools work (F12)

### Architecture Considerations

When making changes, keep these patterns in mind:

- **Engine Abstraction**: Maintain the `WebEngine` interface for cross-platform support
- **AI Action Pipeline**: Follow the Pydantic schema pattern for AI responses
- **Modal Interface**: Preserve vim-like keybinding conventions
- **Data URLs**: Use the established pattern for AI-generated HTML

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed architectural guidelines.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
uv sync

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.13+
```

#### Qt/WebEngine issues on Linux
```bash
# For Wayland users
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland

# For X11 fallback
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb

# For headless testing
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
```

#### AI functionality not working
```bash
# Check API key is set
echo $OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# Test with fallback model
# Modify src/minimal_browser/ai/models.py to use a known working model
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check existing documentation**:
   - `README.md` for basic setup
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical details  
   - `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` for planned features

2. **Search existing issues** on GitHub

3. **Create a new issue** with:
   - Python version
   - Operating system
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages/logs
