# Minimal Browser

Minimal Browser is a vim-inspired Qt WebEngine shell with a built-in AI copilot. It combines modal keyboard navigation, a lightweight UI, and structured AI actions so you can browse, generate content, or perform smart searches without leaving a terminal-style workflow.

> 📄 Looking for a deeper architectural dive? See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ✨ Highlights

- **Modal ergonomics:** NORMAL/COMMAND/INSERT modes with familiar vim keybindings.
- **Native AI assistant:** Structured responses (navigate/search/html) parsed via Pydantic for deterministic actions.
- **Pluggable engines:** Abstract `WebEngine` contract with a Qt WebEngine implementation today and hooks for GTK/others tomorrow.
- **Smart rendering:** AI HTML responses rendered via Jinja templates and injected as data URLs for instant previews.
- **Conversation memory:** Rolling in-memory history plus optional JSON persistence for long-running sessions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.13** (project managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- Qt WebEngine runtime (installed automatically with `PySide6` via uv)
- An **OpenRouter** API key in your environment (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running the Browser

```bash
uv run python -m minimal_browser
# or launch with an initial URL
uv run python -m minimal_browser https://example.com
```

The first run seeds persistent profile data under `~/.minimal-browser/` and conversation history under `~/.minimal_browser/conversations.json`.

## 🤖 AI Configuration

AI models are defined in `src/minimal_browser/ai/models.py`. By default the browser targets `openrouter/openai/gpt-5-codex-preview`, with an automatic fallback to `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` if the preview model is unavailable.

To override the model, adjust the config returned by `AppConfig` (see `src/minimal_browser/config/default_config.py`) or extend the model registry with new entries. Be sure to provide a valid OpenRouter model slug and set the matching API key via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## 🧭 Current Status & Known Gaps

The codebase is evolving quickly. Key gaps we plan to address next:

1. **Docs & onboarding:** This README and `ARCHITECTURE.md` are brand new—expect further polish, screenshots, and task-based guides.
2. **Testing baseline:** There is no automated test suite yet. We intend to add smoke tests for AI parsing, rendering helpers, and conversation logging.
3. **AI UX resiliency:** Errors fall back to notifications; retries and offline modes still need design.
4. **Security review:** Qt WebEngine settings allow local content to access remote URLs and disable XSS auditing for AI-generated HTML. Documenting and tightening this behavior is on the roadmap.
5. **Optional dependency slimming:** Packages like `boto3` and `chromadb` are currently hard dependencies even though their integrations are optional.

For a detailed critique and near-term roadmap, see the **Architecture Roadmap** section in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! For detailed setup instructions, workflow guidance, and how to work with AI-suggested modifications, see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

**Quick contributor checklist:**
1. Ensure Python 3.13+ and run `uv sync` to install dependencies
2. Test changes with `uv run python -m minimal_browser`
3. Follow conventional commit guidelines and architectural patterns
4. Run `uv run python -m py_compile src/minimal_browser/...` before submitting
