# Minimal Browser

Minimal Browser is a vim-inspired Qt WebEngine shell with a built-in AI copilot. It combines modal keyboard navigation, a lightweight UI, and structured AI actions so you can browse, generate content, or perform smart searches without leaving a terminal-style workflow.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Modal ergonomics:** NORMAL/COMMAND/INSERT modes with familiar vim keybindings.
- **Native AI assistant:** Structured responses (navigate/search/html) parsed via Pydantic for deterministic actions.
- **AI vision analysis:** Capture screenshots and analyze them with GPT-4o vision capabilities (Ctrl+Shift+S).
- **Pluggable engines:** Abstract `WebEngine` contract with a Qt WebEngine implementation today and hooks for GTK/others tomorrow.
- **Smart rendering:** AI HTML responses rendered via Jinja templates and injected as data URLs for instant previews.
- **Conversation memory:** Rolling in-memory history plus optional JSON persistence for long-running sessions.
- **Performance optimizations:** Optional native (Rust/C) modules for CPU-intensive operations with transparent fallback to pure Python.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.13** (project managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- Qt WebEngine runtime (installed automatically with `PySide6` via uv)
- An **OpenRouter** API key in your environment (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running the Browser

```bash
uv run python -m minimal_browser
# or launch with an initial URL
uv run python -m minimal_browser https://example.com
```

The first run seeds persistent profile data under `~/.minimal-browser/` and conversation history under `~/.minimal_browser/conversations.json`.

## ü§ñ AI Configuration

AI models are defined in `src/minimal_browser/ai/models.py`. By default the browser targets `openrouter/openai/gpt-5-codex-preview`, with an automatic fallback to `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` if the preview model is unavailable.

To override the model, adjust the config returned by `AppConfig` (see `src/minimal_browser/config/default_config.py`) or extend the model registry with new entries. Be sure to provide a valid OpenRouter model slug and set the matching API key via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

### API Key Management

Minimal Browser supports secure API key storage through system keychains:

- **GNOME Keyring** (Linux)
- **macOS Keychain** (macOS)
- **Windows Credential Manager** (Windows)

**Priority order for loading API keys:**

1. **Environment variables** (highest priority) - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. **System keychain** - Keys stored via `keyring` library
3. **Runtime set keys** (lowest priority) - Temporary keys set during session

**Storing keys in keychain:**

```python
from minimal_browser.ai.auth import auth_manager

# Store a key in the system keychain
auth_manager.set_key('openrouter', 'your-api-key', store_in_keychain=True)

# Keys stored in keychain persist across sessions
```

**Using environment variables (traditional method):**

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
uv run python -m minimal_browser
```

The keychain integration is optional - if `keyring` is not available or fails, the browser will fall back to environment variables only.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations (Optional)

Minimal Browser includes an optional native module system that accelerates CPU-intensive operations (regex matching, base64 encoding, markdown conversion) using Rust. The system provides 2-10x performance improvements while maintaining transparent fallback to pure Python.

**To enable native optimizations (requires Rust):**

```bash
# Install Rust if not already installed
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install maturin (Rust-Python bridge)
pip install maturin

# Build and install native module
cd native_extensions
maturin develop
cd ..
```

**Verify it's working:**

```bash
python3 benchmarks/demo_optimizations.py
```

**Performance benchmarking:**

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.text_processing_benchmark
```

For detailed information, see [`NATIVE_OPTIMIZATION.md`](NATIVE_OPTIMIZATION.md) and [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md).

## üß≠ Current Status & Known Gaps

The codebase is evolving quickly. Key gaps we plan to address next:

1. **Docs & onboarding:** This README and `ARCHITECTURE.md` are brand new‚Äîexpect further polish, screenshots, and task-based guides.
2. **Testing baseline:** There is no automated test suite yet. We intend to add smoke tests for AI parsing, rendering helpers, and conversation logging.
3. **AI UX resiliency:** Errors fall back to notifications; retries and offline modes still need design.
4. **Security review:** Qt WebEngine settings allow local content to access remote URLs and disable XSS auditing for AI-generated HTML. Documenting and tightening this behavior is on the roadmap.
5. **Optional dependency slimming:** Packages like `boto3` and `chromadb` are currently hard dependencies even though their integrations are optional.

For a detailed critique and near-term roadmap, see the **Architecture Roadmap** section in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Snapshot

- **Native module optimization**: Investigation into Tauri and Rust/C++ modules (see `docs/TAURI_INVESTIGATION.md`)

Track progress in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and detailed feature ideas in [`FEATURE_REQUESTS.md`](FEATURE_REQUESTS.md).

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you're planning a sizable change:

1. Open an issue or draft proposal referencing the relevant roadmap/feature entry.
2. Keep pull requests focused; follow conventional commit guidelines if possible.
3. Run `uv run python -m py_compile src/minimal_browser/...` before submitting to catch syntax regressions. (Automated tests coming soon.)
