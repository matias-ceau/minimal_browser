## Quick Summary

This investigation examined whether Tauri could address performance and distribution challenges in minimal_browser. 

### Key Findings

**Current State:**
- ✅ Well-architected with pluggable engine abstraction
- ⚠️ Heavy distribution (300-400MB, primarily Qt WebEngine + PySide6)
- ⚠️ Slower startup (2-3 seconds for Qt initialization)
- ⚠️ Higher memory usage (150-200MB base footprint)

**Tauri Benefits:**
- ✅ Much smaller binaries (5-15MB vs 300MB)
- ✅ Faster startup (<500ms vs 2-3s)
- ✅ Better native OS integration
- ✅ Self-contained distribution

**Tauri Challenges:**
- ❌ Requires Rust rewrite (8-12 weeks effort)
- ❌ Python AI ecosystem unavailable in Rust
- ❌ Steep learning curve for team
- ❌ Hybrid approach has IPC complexity

### Recommendation: Phased Optimization Approach

**Do NOT pursue full Tauri migration.** Instead, follow this phased strategy:

#### Phase 1: Profile & Quick Wins (Weeks 1-2)
- Profile actual performance bottlenecks
- Optimize Qt initialization (lazy loading, background init)
- Move optional dependencies to extras
- **Expected gain:** 20-30% improvements, minimal risk

#### Phase 2: Selective Native Extensions (Weeks 3-6)  
- Use PyO3 for performance-critical hotspots only
- Focus on HTML rendering and data URL generation
- Keep Python development workflow
- **Expected gain:** 30-50% improvements in critical paths

#### Phase 3: Better Distribution (Months 3-4)
- PyInstaller/Nuitka for standalone binaries
- Platform-specific installers
- Auto-update mechanism
- **Expected gain:** 50% reduction in distribution size

#### Phase 4: Evaluate Hybrid Tauri (Months 6+ if needed)
- Only if Phases 1-3 insufficient
- Run 2-week proof of concept
- Make data-driven decision

### Quick Reference: When to Consider Tauri

Use this decision tree:

```
Is distribution size critical (<50MB required)?
├─ NO → Is startup time critical (<1s required)?
│      ├─ NO → Incremental Qt Optimization ✓ (RECOMMENDED)
│      └─ YES → Profile + Selective PyO3 Extensions
└─ YES → Does team have Rust expertise?
         ├─ YES → Tauri Hybrid Architecture (Python subprocess)
         └─ NO → PyInstaller/Nuitka + Qt Lite builds
```

### Performance Profiling

A profiling script is provided to measure current performance:

```bash
# Profile startup time
python scripts/profile_performance.py --startup

# Profile HTML rendering performance
python scripts/profile_performance.py --html-rendering

# Profile memory usage
python scripts/profile_performance.py --memory

# Run all profiling tests
python scripts/profile_performance.py --all
```

### Next Actions

**This Week:**
1. Review investigation with team
2. Run performance profiling baseline
3. Decide on Phase 1 scope

**Weeks 1-2:**
1. Implement Phase 1 optimizations
2. Measure improvements
3. Document results

**Week 3:**
1. Review Phase 1 results
2. Decide whether to proceed to Phase 2
3. Create detailed Phase 2 plan if proceeding

### Success Metrics

Track these metrics to evaluate optimization effectiveness:

| Metric | Current | Phase 1 Target | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Startup time | 2-3s | 2s | 1-1.5s | 0.5-1s |
| Binary size | 300MB | 250MB | 200MB | 100MB |
| Memory usage | 150-200MB | 140-180MB | 120-150MB | 100-120MB |

**Conclusion:** The current Qt WebEngine architecture is appropriate for minimal_browser's needs. Focus on incremental optimizations rather than a risky full migration to Tauri. Re-evaluate if requirements dramatically change.
