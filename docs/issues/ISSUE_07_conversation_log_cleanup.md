# Issue: Remove Redundant Placeholder Comment in ConversationLog.save()

## Priority
**P3 - Low Priority** (Code Cleanup)

## Component
`src/minimal_browser/storage/conversations.py`

## Current State
Line 64 contains a redundant placeholder comment:
```python
def save(self) -> None:
    write_json(self.path, self._entries)
    pass  # Placeholder for future implementation
```

## Description
The `save()` method is actually fully implemented (calls `write_json`), but has a placeholder comment suggesting it's incomplete. This is misleading and should be removed.

## Analysis
The method properly:
1. Writes conversation entries to JSON file via `write_json`
2. The placeholder comment appears to be left over from early development
3. No additional functionality is obviously missing
4. Tests pass, indicating the method works as intended

## Required Changes

### Option 1: Simply Remove Placeholder (Recommended)
```python
def save(self) -> None:
    write_json(self.path, self._entries)
```

### Option 2: Add Meaningful Comment (If Needed)
If there's actual future functionality planned, update the comment to be specific:
```python
def save(self) -> None:
    write_json(self.path, self._entries)
    # TODO: Add compression for large conversation logs
    # TODO: Add backup rotation
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove or update placeholder comment
- [ ] Ensure existing tests still pass
- [ ] No functional changes to the method
- [ ] Clean code with no misleading comments

## Investigation Needed
Before removing, verify if there's any planned functionality:
1. Check ROADMAP.md for conversation storage features
2. Check FEATURE_REQUESTS.md for related items
3. Review git history for context on why placeholder was added
4. Confirm with maintainer if any features are planned

## Possible Future Enhancements (If Applicable)
If there are genuine future features planned, they might include:
- Compression for large logs
- Backup file rotation
- Encryption for sensitive conversations
- Async I/O for better performance
- Checksum/validation for data integrity

If any of these are planned, the comment should be updated to be specific.

## Related Issues/Features
- Related to FR-050: SQLite Conversation Store (may replace this)
- Related to FR-051: Conversation Export Bundles

## Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Review git history: `git log -p src/minimal_browser/storage/conversations.py`
2. Check for related TODOs in codebase
3. Verify no tests expect additional behavior
4. Remove or update comment accordingly
5. Run tests to confirm no regressions

## Assignment
**Suggested for Copilot Agent**: Code cleanup specialist or any agent
**Estimated Effort**: 5-10 minutes (trivial change)
**Dependencies**: None

## Notes
- This is a trivial cleanup issue
- Can be combined with other small cleanup tasks
- Very low priority, doesn't affect functionality
- Good "first issue" for new contributors
- May be deferred if SQLite migration (FR-050) is planned soon
