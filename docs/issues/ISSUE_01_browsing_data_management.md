# Issue: Implement Browsing Data Management Module

## Priority
**P2 - Medium Priority** (aligns with ROADMAP.md "Storage & Productivity" section)

## Component
`src/minimal_browser/storage/browsing_data.py`

## Current State
Complete placeholder module with only a docstring outlining future features:
```python
"""
Placeholder for browsing data management.

Future implementation will include:
- History tracking
- Cache management
- Cookie storage
- Session management
"""
```

## Description
The browsing data management module needs to be implemented to provide comprehensive data persistence and management for the browser. This is a foundational feature for user productivity and data retention.

## Required Features

### 1. History Tracking
- Track visited URLs with timestamps
- Store page titles and metadata
- Provide search/filter capabilities
- Support history export
- Implement history clearing with date ranges

### 2. Cache Management
- Interface with Qt WebEngine cache settings
- Provide cache size management
- Clear cache functionality
- Cache statistics/reporting

### 3. Cookie Storage
- Interface with Qt WebEngine cookie store
- List and inspect cookies
- Delete cookies selectively or all
- Cookie persistence settings

### 4. Session Management
- Save browser state (open tabs, URLs)
- Restore sessions on restart
- Named session profiles
- Session export/import

## Technical Considerations

### Storage Backend
- Consider using SQLite for structured data (history, sessions)
- JSON for simple session snapshots
- Align with existing `ConversationLog` patterns in `storage/conversations.py`

### Integration Points
- `minimal_browser.py`: Main browser class for session restoration
- `engines/qt_engine.py`: Qt WebEngine cache and cookie APIs
- Configuration system for data retention policies

### Security & Privacy
- Respect user privacy preferences
- Implement secure deletion (VACUUM for SQLite)
- Document data storage locations
- Consider encryption for sensitive data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] History database with CRUD operations
- [ ] Cache management interface
- [ ] Cookie inspection and deletion
- [ ] Session save/restore functionality
- [ ] Unit tests for all storage operations
- [ ] Documentation for API and data schemas
- [ ] Integration with existing configuration system

## Related Issues/Features
- Links to ROADMAP.md P2 "Storage & Productivity"
- May relate to FR-050 (SQLite Conversation Store)
- Consider bookmark integration (FR-052)

## Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start with history tracking (SQLite schema + CRUD)
2. Add session management (JSON snapshots)
3. Integrate cache management with Qt WebEngine
4. Add cookie management capabilities
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Document APIs and usage examples

## Assignment
**Suggested for Copilot Agent**: Storage/Database specialist agent
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days for complete implementation
**Dependencies**: None (standalone module)
